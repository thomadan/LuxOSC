## LxOSC
Android application sending light sensor values as OSC messages over network through the UDP protocol.




### Credits

The application utilizes the [JavaOSC](https://github.com/hoijui/JavaOSC) library originally developed by [illposed](http://www.illposed.com/), allowing for creating and sending OSC messages over UDP.

The dual thumb range seekbar library used here is [anothem](https://github.com/anothem)'s fork of [this](https://code.google.com/archive/p/range-seek-bar/) project, and is found on Github [here](https://github.com/anothem/android-range-seek-bar).

Implementation of the splash screen is using portions of [cstew](https://github.com/cstew)'s code found [here](https://github.com/cstew/Splash).


### Building and running the app

Opening this project in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), one has the option of loading the application onto a connected Android device with [developer mode enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html).
